To integrate **TestDriver.ai** with a workflow that uses the **runner artifact URL** and **GitHub token** for downloading artifacts, you can modify the workflow to include these steps. Below is an example of how to adapt the workflow to ensure TestDriver.ai can access the artifacts.

## Updated Workflow with TestDriver.ai Integration

This workflow builds the application, uploads the build as an artifact, and then uses TestDriver.ai to download the artifact via the runner artifact URL and run tests.

### Workflow File: `.github/workflows/testdriver-integration.yml````yaml
name: Build and Test with TestDriver.ai

    steps:
      - name: Check out repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3

      - name: Install dependencies

        run: npm run build # Ensure your project has a build script

      - name: Upload Build Artifact
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
        with:
          name: app-build
          path: dist/ # Replace with the path to your built application

          echo "ARTIFACT_URL=${{ github.server_url }}/repos/${{ github.repository }}/actions/artifacts" >> $GITHUB_ENV

            1. Download the artifact from the runner URL
            2. Extract the artifact
            3. Run the application
            4. Verify the main window loads correctly
            5. Perform additional tests
          prerun: |

              --output artifact.zip
            echo "Extracting artifact..."
            unzip artifact.zip -d ./app
            echo "Running application..."
            ./app/your-app-binary # Replace with the actual binary or executable path
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          FORCE_COLOR: "3"

```

## Key Changes and Explanation

### 1. **Artifact URL Retrieval**
The `Get Artifact URL` step constructs the artifact URL dynamically using the GitHub repository and server URL. This ensures the TestDriver.ai runner can download the artifact.```yaml
- name: Get Artifact URL
  id: artifact-url
  run: |
    echo "ARTIFACT_URL=${{ github.server_url }}/repos/${{ github.repository }}/actions/artifacts" >> $GITHUB_ENV

```

---

### 2. **Downloading the Artifact**
The `prerun` script in the TestDriver.ai action uses `curl` to download the artifact from the runner URL. The `GITHUB_TOKEN` is passed as a header for authentication.```yaml
prerun: |
  echo "Downloading artifact..."
  curl -H "Authorization: Bearer ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}" \
    -L "${{ env.ARTIFACT_URL }}" \
    --output artifact.zip
  echo "Extracting artifact..."
  unzip artifact.zip -d ./app
  echo "Running application..."
  ./app/your-app-binary # Replace with the actual binary or executable path

```

---

### 3. **TestDriver.ai Integration**
The TestDriver.ai action is configured to:
- Download the artifact.
- Extract the artifact.
- Run the application.
- Execute the specified test steps.```yaml
- name: Run Tests with TestDriver.ai
  uses: testdriverai/action@main
  with:
    key: ${{ secrets.TESTDRIVER_API_KEY }}
    prompt: |
      1. Download the artifact from the runner URL
      2. Extract the artifact
      3. Run the application
      4. Verify the main window loads correctly
      5. Perform additional tests

```

---

## Secrets Configuration

Add the following secrets to your GitHub repository:
1. **`TESTDRIVER_API_KEY`**: Your TestDriver.ai API key.
2. **`GITHUB_TOKEN`**: Automatically provided by GitHub Actions for authentication.

---

## Benefits of This Workflow

1. **Dynamic Artifact Access**: Ensures TestDriver.ai can download artifacts directly from the runner.
2. **Automated Testing**: Integrates TestDriver.ai to validate the application after the build.
3. **Secure Authentication**: Uses the GitHub token for secure artifact access.
4. **Cross-Platform Support**: Can be adapted for different operating systems and environments.

---

By integrating TestDriver.ai with the runner artifact URL and GitHub token, this workflow ensures seamless testing of your application builds.
