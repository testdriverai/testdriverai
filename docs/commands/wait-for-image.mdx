## Description

The `wait-for-image` command waits until the specified image is detected on the screen. This is useful for ensuring that visual elements are present before proceeding with the next steps in a test.

## Arguments

| Argument      | Type     | Description                                                                                 |
| ------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `description` | `string` | A description of the image.                                                                 |
| `timeout`     | `number` | (Optional) The duration in milliseconds to wait for the image to appear. Default is `5000`. |

## Example usage

```yaml
command: wait-for-image
description: trash icon
timeout: 5000
```

## Protips

- Use clear and concise descriptions for the image to improve detection accuracy.
- Adjust the `timeout` value based on the expected load time of the image to avoid unnecessary delays.

## Gotchas

- If the image doesn't appear within the specified `timeout`, the command will fail.
- Ensure the description accurately represents the image to avoid detection issues.

## Notes

- The `wait-for-image` command is ideal for synchronizing tests with visual elements that may take time to load.
- This command supports flexible timeouts to accommodate varying load times.
