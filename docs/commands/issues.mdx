## Reporting issues

If you encounter any issues while using TestDriver, please report them to us. You can do this by creating a new issue in our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/testdriverai/testdriverai/issues/new). We appreciate your feedback and will work to resolve any problems as quickly as possible.

## Known issues

### Image description matches

TestDriver may not accurately match image descriptions in certain cases. This can lead to unexpected behavior when using the `hover-image` command. For example, if you specify a description that's too generic or similar to other images on the screen, TestDriver may not be able to identify the correct image to interact with. To improve accuracy, use specific and unique descriptions for images.

<Tip>
To get better accuracy and determinism it is recommended to upload the image to [chatgpt](https://chatgpt.com) and ask it to describe the image and use the generated `description`.
</Tip>

### Text substrings

TestDriver may not accurately match text substrings in certain cases. This can lead to unexpected behavior when using the `hover-text` command.
