The TestDriver VS Code extension is a powerful tool that integrates TestDriver's AI-driven test generation capabilities directly into your development environment:

- Get started with example scripts for different platforms
- Get syntax highlighting and autocompletion for [TestDriver YAML](/getting-started/editing)
- Chat with the TestDriver agent to generate tests based on your requirements
- Save and manage your tests directly within your project
- Run and debug tests directly from the IDE
- View test results and logs within the IDE

<Tip>

  <Step title="Set Your TestDriver API Key">
    
    After installing the extension, you'll need to set your TestDriver API key in the extension settings.

    1. Open the command palette (Cmd+Shift+P or Ctrl+Shift+P).
    2. Search for "Preferences: Open Settings (UI)" and select it.
    3. In the search bar, type "TestDriver" to filter the settings.
    4. Find the "TestDriver: Set API Key" field and enter your API key from [the TestDriver dashboard](https://app.testdriver.ai/team).

    <Tip>You can also set the `TD_API_KEY` environment variable in your system if you prefer not to enter it directly in the extension settings.</Tip>

  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose a Platform">
    Click on the TestDriver icon in the sidebar to open the extension panel and choose a platform to get started (Web, Desktop, or Mobile).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create Your First Test">
    Now chat with the TestDriver agent to create your first test! Describe what you want to test, and the agent will generate the test steps for you.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Run your test">
    Run your test by clicking the "Run" button in the extension panel. You can view the test results and logs directly within VS Code's Test Explorer. [Learn more about running tests in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/debugtest/testing).

**Pro Tip:** Always start with interactive mode (`testdriverai`) to explore and refine your tests before saving them. It's faster and more intuitive\!
