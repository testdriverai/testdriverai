      VS Code is the recommended IDE for TestDriver. First, install the following recommended extensions:

      - [GitHub Copilot Chat](vscode://github.copilot-chat) (The free plan is just fine!)
      - [VS Code YAML](vscode://redhat.vscode-yaml) (Optional, but recommended for YAML validation)

      Then, download the TestDriver extension:

        href="https://github.com/testdriverai/vscode/releases/latest/download/testdriver.vsix"
      >
        Get the latest version from GitHub releases.
      </Card>

      Finally, install the extension in VS Code. You can do this by dragging and dropping the downloaded `.vsix` file into the VS Code window.

    Use JetBrains IDEs, VIM, or other editors? No problem! You can use TestDriver with the CLI. This quickstart contains both GUI and terminal commands to help you get started.

<Step title="Install TestDriver">
Install the TestDriver CLI globally:  
```bash
npm install -g testdriverai
```
</Step>

<Step title="Initialize Your Project">
  Set up your project with: ```bash testdriverai init ``` This creates a `.env`
  file and sample workflow files.
</Step>

<Step title="Run TestDriver in Interactive Mode">
Start TestDriver in interactive mode to create and refine tests dynamically:  
```bash
testdriverai
```  
Once started, you can use commands like `/try`, `/undo`, and `/save` to interactively build and test your flows.

<YmlWarning/>
</Step>

<Step title="Define Your Test Steps">
  Use natural language to describe what you want to test. For example: ``` >
  Open Google Chrome and search for "testdriverai" ``` TestDriver will generate
  steps like: ```yaml - command: focus-application name: Google Chrome -
  command: hover-text text: Search Google or type a URL description: main search
  bar action: click - command: type text: testdriverai - command: press-keys
  keys: [enter] ```
</Step>

<Step title="Refine and Save Your Test">
  - Use `/undo` to remove the last step if needed. - Save your test with `/save`
  to generate a reusable YAML file.
</Step>

<Step title="Run Saved Tests">
  Once saved, you can run your test file anytime: ```bash testdriverai run
  path/to/test.yaml ```
</Step>

</Steps>

**Pro Tip:** Always start with interactive mode (`testdriverai`) to explore and refine your tests before saving them. It's faster and more intuitive!
