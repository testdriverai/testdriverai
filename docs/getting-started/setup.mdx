### **TestDriver Installation Guide**

Follow these steps to install and set up TestDriver:

---


<Steps>

  <Step title="Install NodeJS">

    Ensure you have Node.js (v16 or higher) installed.

    Check your Node.js version:
    
    ```bash
    node -v
    ```
    
    If not installed, download it from [Node.js Official Website](https://nodejs.org/).

  </Step>
  <Step title="Install NPM">
    **npm**: Comes with Node.js. Verify `npm` is installed:
    
    ```bash
    npm -v
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Install TestDriver">
  
    Install the TestDriver CLI globally using npm:
  
    ```bash
    npm install -g testdriverai
    ```
  
    Verify the installation:
  
    ```bash
    testdriverai --version
    ```
  </Step>


  <Step title="Set Up Your Test Runner">

    TestDriver requires a runner to execute tests. You can use either a hosted sandbox or your own computer.
    
    - **TestDriver Sandbox** - Run tests in a ephemeral linux virtual machine. Recommended for ease of use, added privacy, and parallelization. Requires a TestDriver API key.
    - **Local Runner** - Run tests on your own computer. Recommended for working with existing user sessions, files, and applications. Requires additional setup.

    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="Hosted Sandbox Setup">

        Run `testdriverai init` in your project directory and choose "yes" for the sandbox option. This will prompt you for your API key.

        ```
        Beginning setup...
        ✔ Use TestDriver Sandbox Runners? (Recommended) … yes
        ? API KEY (from https://app.testdriver.ai/team) › ********
        ```

        This will write the `TD_VM` and `TD_API_KEY` values to `.env` file in your project directory.

      </Tab>
      <Tab title="Local Windows Setup">

        #### Install Python & Visual Studio Build Tools

        ```powershell
        choco install python visualstudio2022-workload-vctools -y
        ```

        #### Install NodeJS

        You will also need NodeJS if you don't have it yet.

        ```powershell
        choco install nodejs-lts --version="20.17.0"
        ```

        #### Set Execution Policy

        Open a new terminal with admin privileges and execute the following command : 
        ```powershell
        Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
        ```
      This gives TestDriver the right to execute it's scripts and is only valid for the current user. 
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="Local Mac Setup">
        #### Enable Screen Recording Permissions
        
        TestDriver requires screen recording permissions to capture your screen during test execution.

        - Open **System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy > Screen Recording**.
        - Check the box next to your terminal application (e.g., Terminal, iTerm2) to allow screen recording.
        
        This is required for TestDriver to capture your screen during test execution.
        
        #### Enable Accessibility Permissions
        
        - Open **System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy > Accessibility**.
        - Check the box next to your terminal application (e.g., Terminal, iTerm2) to allow accessibility features.

        This is required for TestDriver to interact with your applications during test execution.
