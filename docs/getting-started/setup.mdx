<Steps>
  <Step title="Install Node.js">
    Ensure you have Node.js (v16 or higher) installed.

    Check your Node.js version:

    ```bash
    node -v
    ```

    If not installed, download it from [Node.js Official Website](https://nodejs.org/).

  </Step>
  <Step title="Install NPM">
    **npm**: Comes with Node.js. Verify `npm` is installed:

    ```bash
    npm -v
    ```

  </Step>
  <Step title="Set Up Your Test Runner" stepNumber={3}>
    In your project directory, run the interactive setup process:

    ```sh
    npx testdriverai@latest init
    ```

{" "}

<Tip>
  TestDriver runs on a dedicated virtual machine which makes it easier to use
  without having to install much of programs on your local machine.
</Tip>

        ```
        🚀 Initializing TestDriver project ...
        ? API KEY (from https://app.testdriver.ai/team) › ********
        ```

        This will write the `TD_API_KEY` values to `.env` file in your project directory.

        You will also be prompted to add the website that you want to test, if you are about to test a desktop application or any non web application skip it by pressing enter, else make sure to enter the url of your website.
        You can always change the website later by editing the `.env` file in your project directory.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Run TestDriver in Interactive Mode" stepNumber={4}>
    Once the setup is completed you will notice a new folder called `testdriver` in your project directory.
    Inside this folder you will see the [lifecycle files](/guide/lifecycle)

    To start TestDriver in interactive mode run the below command:

    ```bash
    npx testdriverai@latest edit
    ```

    You are now inside our CLI terminal and the first thing that happens is, you will be given a new sandbox instance, so expect a new browser window to open that basically contains a windows machine instance.

    ```bash
    Howdy! I'm TestDriver v6.0.0
    Working on /Users/kid/Desktop/my-project/testdriver/testdriver.yaml
    - establishing connection...
    - authenticating...
    - creating new sandbox...
      (this can take between 10 - 240 seconds)
    - connecting...
    >
    ```
    You can now start writing your prompts after the `>`
