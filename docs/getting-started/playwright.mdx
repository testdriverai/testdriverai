<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a TestDriver Account">
    You will need a [TestDriver Pro](https://app.testdriver.ai/team) account ($20/month) to get an API key.

    <Card
      title="Sign Up for TestDriver"
      icon="user-plus"
      href="https://app.testdriver.ai/team"
      arrow
      horizontal
    />

  </Step>
  <Step title="Set up your environment">
      
    Copy your API key from [the TestDriver dashboard](https://app.testdriver.ai/team), and set it as an environment variable.
    
    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="macOS / Linux">
        ```bash Export an environment variable on macOS or Linux systems
        export TD_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
        ```
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="Windows">
      ```powershell Export an environment variable in PowerShell
      setx TD_API_KEY "your_api_key_here"
      ```
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Initialize Playwright">

    <Info>
      This is a condensed version of [Playwright's Installation Instructions](https://playwright.dev/docs/intro).

      **If you're new to Playwright, you should follow their guide first.**
    </Info>

    In an new folder or existing run:

    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="npm">
        ```bash
        npm init playwright@latest
        ```
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="yarn">
        ```bash
        yarn create playwright
        ```
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="pnpm">
        ```bash
        pnpm create playwright
        ```
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>

    Select the following options when prompted:

    ```console
    ✔ Do you want to use TypeScript or JavaScript?
    > TypeScript
    ✔ Where to put your end-to-end tests?
    > tests
    ✔ Add a GitHub Actions workflow? (y/N)
    > N
    ✔ Install Playwright browsers (can be done manually via 'npx playwright install')? (Y/n)
    > Y
    ```

  </Step>

  <Step title="Install TestDriver">

    TestDriver provides a backwards-compatible wrapper around `@playwright/test`.

    Install `@testdriver.ai/playwright` in your Playwright project.

    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="npm">
        ```bash
        npm install @testdriver.ai/playwright
        ```
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="yarn">
        ```bash
        yarn add @testdriver.ai/playwright
        ```
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="pnpm">
        ```bash
        pnpm add @testdriver.ai/playwright
        ```
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>

  </Step>

  <Step title="Run Playwright">

    Before we start using TestDriver in our tests, run Playwright in UI Mode:

    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="npm">
        ```bash
        npx playwright test --ui
        ```
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="yarn">
        ```bash
        yarn playwright test --ui
        ```
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="pnpm">
        ```bash
        pnpm exec playwright test --ui
        ```
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>

    <Tip>Learn more about UI Mode in the [Playwright documentation](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-ui-mode).</Tip>

    You should be able to successfully run your Playwright tests before continuing.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Replace Playwright with TestDriver">

    Replace `@playwright/test` with `@testdriver.ai/playwright` in your test files.

    ```typescript icon="square-js" title="tests/example.spec.ts"
    import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test'; // [!code --]
    import { test, expect } from '@testdriver.ai/playwright'; // [!code ++]
    ```
