# Automating Jira ticket creation for test failures using TestDriver CLI and Jira GitHub Actions

This guide explains how to integrate the **TestDriver CLI** with the **Jira GitHub Action** to automatically create a Jira ticket whenever a TestDriver test fails. This workflow ensures that test failures are tracked in Jira, enabling teams to address issues promptly.

---

## Workflow overview

<Steps>
  <Step title="Run Tests with TestDriver CLI">
    Use the TestDriver CLI with the --headless flag to execute your test suite
    in a headless environment.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Check for Test Failures">
    Capture the test results and determine if any tests failed.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create a Jira Ticket">
    Use the Jira GitHub Action to create a new ticket for each test failure,
    including relevant details such as the test name, failure reason, and logs.
  </Step>
</Steps>
---

## Prerequisites

1. **TestDriver API Key**: Store your API key as a GitHub secret (for example, `TD_API_KEY`).
2. **Jira API Token**: Generate an API token from your Jira account and store it as a GitHub secret (for example, `JIRA_API_TOKEN`).
3. **Jira Base URL**: Your Jira instance URL (for example, `https://yourcompany.atlassian.net`).
4. **Jira Project Key**: The key of the Jira project where tickets will be created (for example, `TEST`).
5. **TestDriver CLI**: The TestDriver CLI must be installed and configured in your workflow.

## GitHub Actions workflow

Here's a complete workflow that integrates TestDriver and Jira:

### Workflow File: `.github/workflows/testdriver-jira.yaml`

```yaml [expandable]

          } else {

          }

## Workflow steps explained

### 1. **Run Tests with TestDriver CLI**

The TestDriver CLI runs your tests in headless mode using the `--headless` flag. The `--output` flag specifies where to save the test results for later use in Jira tickets.

```yaml
- name: Run TestDriver
  id: testdriver
  run: npx testdriverai@latest run testdriver/test.yaml --headless --key $env:TD_API_KEY --output="testdriver-output.txt"
  env:
    TD_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.TD_API_KEY }}
  shell: powershell
```

---

### 2. **Check for test failures**

This step checks the exit code and success status from the TestDriver CLI run. If the tests failed, it sets an environment variable (`failure=true`) to trigger the Jira ticket creation step and prepares the output file for the Jira ticket.

```yaml
- name: Check for Test Failures
  id: check-failures
  run: |
    if ("${{ steps.testdriver.outputs.success }}" -eq "false") {
      echo "TestDriver tests failed."
      echo "failure=true" >> $env:GITHUB_ENV
      
      # Copy the output file for Jira ticket
      Copy-Item testdriver-output.txt failure-details.txt
    } else {
      echo "All tests passed."
      echo "failure=false" >> $env:GITHUB_ENV
    }
  shell: powershell
```

---

### 3. **Create a Jira ticket**

If any tests failed, the `create-jira-ticket` job uses the `atlassian/gajira-create` action to create a new Jira ticket. The ticket includes:

- **Summary**: A brief description of the failure with repository information.
- **Description**: Detailed information about the failure, including repository details, workflow run links, and the captured test output.

```yaml
- name: Create Jira Ticket
  uses: atlassian/gajira-create@v3
  with:
    url: ${{ secrets.JIRA_BASE_URL }}
    user: ${{ secrets.JIRA_USERNAME }}
    api-token: ${{ secrets.JIRA_API_TOKEN }}
    project: TEST # Replace with your Jira project key
    summary: "TestDriver Test Failure in ${{ github.repository }}"
    description: |
      A test failure occurred during the TestDriver workflow.

      **Repository**: ${{ github.repository }}
      **Branch**: ${{ github.ref }}
      **Commit**: ${{ github.sha }}
      **Workflow Run**: ${{ github.server_url }}/${{ github.repository }}/actions/runs/${{ github.run_id }}

      **Failure Details**:
      $(cat failure-details.txt)

      Please investigate the issue and resolve it promptly.

## Secrets configuration

Add the following secrets to your GitHub repository:

1. **`TD_API_KEY`**: Your TestDriver API key.
2. **`JIRA_API_TOKEN`**: Your Jira API token.
3. **`JIRA_BASE_URL`**: Your Jira instance URL (for example, `https://yourcompany.atlassian.net`).
4. **`JIRA_USERNAME`**: Your Jira account email.

---

## Lifecycle files

TestDriver supports lifecycle files to customize test execution at different phases. These files replace the previous `prerun` parameter from the GitHub Action and provide more comprehensive control over the test environment.

The main lifecycle files are:

- **`lifecycle/provision.yaml`**: Executed when a new sandbox is created
- **`lifecycle/prerun.yaml`**: Executed before tests run (replaces the old `prerun` parameter)
- **`lifecycle/postrun.yaml`**: Executed after tests complete

<Note>
  These lifecycle files should be placed in your repository's `lifecycle/`
  directory and will be automatically executed by TestDriver during the
  appropriate phases.
</Note>

For detailed information about lifecycle files, including complete examples and best practices, see the [Lifecycle Files guide](/guide/lifecycle).

## Example Jira ticket

### Summary:

`TestDriver Test Failure in mycompany/myproject`

### Description:

```
A test failure occurred during the TestDriver workflow.

**Repository**: mycompany/myproject
**Branch**: refs/heads/main
**Commit**: abc123def456
**Workflow Run**: https://github.com/mycompany/myproject/actions/runs/123456789

**Failure Details**:
```

TestDriver CLI execution failed
Error: Test 'Login Test' failed - element not found
Exit code: 1

```

Please investigate the issue and resolve it promptly.

```

## Benefits of this workflow

1. **Automated Issue Tracking**: Automatically creates Jira tickets for test failures, ensuring no issues are overlooked.
2. **Detailed Context**: Includes test output, repository information, and workflow run links in the Jira ticket for easier debugging.
3. **Streamlined Workflow**: Integrates testing and issue tracking into a single automated pipeline.
4. **Flexible Lifecycle Management**: Supports custom setup, provisioning, and cleanup through lifecycle files.

---

By combining TestDriver CLI with Jira GitHub Actions, you can automate the process of tracking test failures, improving collaboration and ensuring faster resolution of issues.
