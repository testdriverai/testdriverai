# Automating Jira Ticket Creation for Test Failures Using TestDriver and Jira GitHub Actions

This guide explains how to integrate the **TestDriver GitHub Action** with the **Jira GitHub Action** to automatically create a Jira ticket whenever a TestDriver test fails. This workflow ensures that test failures are tracked in Jira, enabling teams to address issues promptly.

---

## Workflow Overview

<Steps>
<Step title="Run Tests with TestDriver">Use the TestDriver GitHub Action to execute your test suite.</Step>
<Step title="Check for Test Failures">Capture the test results and determine if any tests failed.</Step>
<Step title="Create a Jira Ticket">Use the Jira GitHub Action to create a new ticket for each test failure, including relevant details such as the test name, failure reason, and logs.</Step>
</Steps>
---

## Prerequisites

1. **TestDriver API Key**: Store your API key as a GitHub secret (for example, `TD_API_KEY`).
2. **Jira API Token**: Generate an API token from your Jira account and store it as a GitHub secret (for example, `JIRA_API_TOKEN`).
3. **Jira Base URL**: Your Jira instance URL (for example, `https://yourcompany.atlassian.net`).
4. **Jira Project Key**: The key of the Jira project where tickets will be created (for example, `TEST`).

## GitHub Actions Workflow

Here's a complete workflow that integrates TestDriver and Jira:

### Workflow File: `.github/workflows/testdriver-jira.yml`
```yaml
name: TestDriver with Jira Integration

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  pull_request:
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  run-tests:
    name: Run Tests with TestDriver
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Check out repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Run TestDriver
        id: testdriver
        uses: testdriverai/action@main
        with:
          key: ${{ secrets.TD_API_KEY }}
          prompt: |
            1. Run all tests in the testdriver directory
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          FORCE_COLOR: "3"

      - name: Check for Test Failures
        id: check-failures
        run: |
          if [[ "${{ steps.testdriver.outputs.success }}" == "false" ]]; then
            echo "TestDriver tests failed."
            echo "failure=true" >> $GITHUB_ENV
          else
            echo "All tests passed."
            echo "failure=false" >> $GITHUB_ENV
          fi

  create-jira-ticket:
    name: Create Jira Ticket for Test Failures
    needs: run-tests
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    if: env.failure == 'true'
    steps:
      - name: Create Jira Ticket
        uses: atlassian/gajira-create@v3
        with:
          url: ${{ secrets.JIRA_BASE_URL }}
          user: ${{ secrets.JIRA_USERNAME }}
          api-token: ${{ secrets.JIRA_API_TOKEN }}
          project: TEST # Replace with your Jira project key
          summary: "Test Failure: ${{ steps.testdriver.outputs.summary }}"
          description: |
            A test failure occurred during the TestDriver workflow.

            **Test Summary**:
            ${{ steps.testdriver.outputs.summary }}

            **Failure Details**:
            ${{ steps.testdriver.outputs.markdown }}

            Please investigate the issue and resolve it promptly.

## Workflow Steps Explained

### 1. **Run Tests with TestDriver**
The `testdriverai/action@main` step runs your TestDriver tests and captures the results. The `outputs.success` variable indicates whether the tests passed or failed.
```yaml
- name: Run TestDriver
  id: testdriver
  uses: testdriverai/action@main
  with:
    key: ${{ secrets.TD_API_KEY }}
    prompt: |
      1. Run all tests in the testdriver directory
  env:
    GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    FORCE_COLOR: "3"

```

---

### 2. **Check for Test Failures**
This step checks the `outputs.success` variable from the TestDriver action. If the tests failed, it sets an environment variable (`failure=true`) to trigger the Jira ticket creation step.
```yaml
- name: Check for Test Failures
  id: check-failures
  run: |
    if [[ "${{ steps.testdriver.outputs.success }}" == "false" ]]; then
      echo "TestDriver tests failed."
      echo "failure=true" >> $GITHUB_ENV
    else
      echo "All tests passed."
      echo "failure=false" >> $GITHUB_ENV
    fi

```

---

### 3. **Create a Jira Ticket**
If any tests failed, the `create-jira-ticket` job uses the `atlassian/gajira-create` action to create a new Jira ticket. The ticket includes:
- **Summary**: A brief description of the failure.
- **Description**: Detailed information about the failure, including the test summary and markdown output from TestDriver.
```yaml
- name: Create Jira Ticket
  uses: atlassian/gajira-create@v3
  with:
    url: ${{ secrets.JIRA_BASE_URL }}
    user: ${{ secrets.JIRA_USERNAME }}
    api-token: ${{ secrets.JIRA_API_TOKEN }}
    project: TEST # Replace with your Jira project key
    summary: "Test Failure: ${{ steps.testdriver.outputs.summary }}"
    description: |
      A test failure occurred during the TestDriver workflow.

      **Test Summary**:
      ${{ steps.testdriver.outputs.summary }}

      **Failure Details**:
      ${{ steps.testdriver.outputs.markdown }}

      Please investigate the issue and resolve it promptly.
    issuetype: Bug

```

## Secrets Configuration

Add the following secrets to your GitHub repository:
1. **`TD_API_KEY`**: Your TestDriver API key.
2. **`JIRA_API_TOKEN`**: Your Jira API token.
3. **`JIRA_BASE_URL`**: Your Jira instance URL (for example, `https://yourcompany.atlassian.net`).
4. **`JIRA_USERNAME`**: Your Jira account email.

---

## Example Jira Ticket

### Summary:
`Test Failure: Login Test Failed`

### Description:


```
A test failure occurred during the TestDriver workflow.

**Test Summary**:
Login Test Failed

**Failure Details**:
- The login button was not clickable.
- The error message was not displayed.

Please investigate the issue and resolve it promptly.

```

## Benefits of This Workflow

1. **Automated Issue Tracking**: Automatically creates Jira tickets for test failures, ensuring no issues are overlooked.
2. **Detailed Context**: Includes test summaries and failure details in the Jira ticket for easier debugging.
3. **Streamlined Workflow**: Integrates testing and issue tracking into a single automated pipeline.

By combining TestDriver and Jira GitHub Actions, you can automate the process of tracking test failures, improving collaboration and ensuring faster resolution of issues.
