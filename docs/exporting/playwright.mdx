This guide explains how to use **TestDriver** to generate Playwright test scripts and integrate them into your repository using a GitHub Actions workflow. The workflow automates the process of generating Playwright tests, creating a pull request with the generated test, and ensuring all dependencies are installed.

---

## Workflow Overview

1. **Install Playwright**: The workflow installs Playwright and its dependencies.
2. **Generate Playwright Test**: TestDriver generates a Playwright test script using the `playwright codegen` tool.
3. **Create Pull Request**: The generated test is committed to a new branch, and a pull request is created for review.

---

## Prerequisites

1. **GitHub Repository**: Ensure your project is hosted on GitHub.
2. **TestDriver API Key**: Store your API key as a GitHub secret (for example, `TD_API_KEY`).
3. **Node.js Installed**: Playwright requires Node.js to run.

---

## GitHub Actions Workflow

Here's the GitHub Actions workflow to automate the process:

### Workflow File: `.github/workflows/playwright.yml`

```yaml
name: TestDriver / Playwright

on:
  push:
    branches: ["main"]
  pull_request:
  workflow_dispatch:

permissions:
  actions: write
  contents: write
  statuses: write
  pull-requests: write

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Check out repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
        with:
          ref: ${{ github.event.ref }}

      - uses: testdriverai/action@main
        with:
          key: ${{ secrets.TD_API_KEY }}

          create-pr: true
          pr-base: main
          pr-title: "TestDriver / Generate Playwright Test"
          pr-branch: generate-playwright
          pr-test-filename: generate-playwright.yml

          prompt: 1. /run testdriver/test.yml
          prerun: |
            echo "Step 1: Installing Playwright globally"
            npm install playwright -g

            echo "Step 2: Installing Playwright dependencies"
            playwright install --with-deps chromium

            echo "Step 3: Generating Playwright script"
            npx playwright codegen --target playwright-test -o testdriver/pw-test.spec.js https://airbnb.com

            echo "Step 4: Completed Playwright test generation"
            exit

        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          FORCE_COLOR: "3"


```

## Workflow Steps Explained

### 1. **Check Out Repository**
The workflow checks out the repository to ensure the latest code is available for the test generation process.
```yaml
- name: Check out repository
  uses: actions/checkout@v2
  with:
    ref: $\{\{ github.event.ref }}
```

---

### 2. **Install Playwright**
The `prerun` script installs Playwright globally and sets up its dependencies (for example, Chromium browser).
```bash
npm install playwright -g
playwright install --with-deps chromium

```
---

### 3. **Generate Playwright Test**
The `playwright codegen` command generates a Playwright test script (`pw-test.spec.js`) for the specified URL (`https://airbnb.com`).
```bash
npx playwright codegen --target playwright-test -o testdriver/pw-test.spec.js https://airbnb.com
```
---

### 4. **Create Pull Request**
The workflow commits the generated test script to a new branch (`generate-playwright`) and creates a pull request with the title `TestDriver / Generate Playwright Test`.
```yaml
create-pr: true
pr-base: main
pr-title: "TestDriver / Generate Playwright Test"
pr-branch: generate-playwright
pr-test-filename: generate-playwright.yml
```

---

## Running the Workflow

<Steps>
<Step title="Trigger the Workflow">
  - Push changes to the `main` branch.
  - Open a pull request.
  - Manually trigger the workflow using the **workflow_dispatch** event.
  </Step>
<Step title="Review the Pull Request">
  - Navigate to the **Pull Requests** tab in your GitHub repository.
  - Review the generated Playwright test script (`pw-test.spec.js`).
  </Step>

<Step title="Merge the Pull Request">
  - Once reviewed, merge the pull request to include the generated test in your repository.
</Step>
</Steps>
---

## Example Output

- **Generated Test File**: `testdriver/pw-test.spec.js`
- **Pull Request**: A new pull request titled `TestDriver / Generate Playwright Test` will be created.

---

## Best Practices

1. **Secure API Key**: Store the TestDriver API key as a GitHub secret to avoid exposing sensitive information.
2. **Review Generated Tests**: Always review the generated Playwright test scripts to ensure they meet your requirements.
3. **Customize Test Generation**: Modify the `playwright codegen` command to target specific URLs or workflows.

By following this guide, you can seamlessly integrate TestDriver with Playwright to generate and manage end-to-end tests in your GitHub repository.
