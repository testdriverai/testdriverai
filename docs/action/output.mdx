## Overview
The TestDriver GitHub Action provides several output variables that can be used to create powerful workflows by chaining actions together. These outputs allow you to post results as comments, send notifications, or integrate with third-party test reporting tools.

## Output Variables

| Variable   | Description                                                                 |
|------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `summary`  | Contains the TestDriver AI text summary result of the action execution.     |
| `link`     | A link to the Dashcam dashboard for debugging test runs.                   |
| `markdown` | Markdown-formatted shareable link, including a screenshot of the desktop.  |
| `success`  | Indicates whether the action passed successfully (`true` or `false`).      |

---

## Example: Creating a Comment on a Pull Request
The following example demonstrates how to use the output variables to create a comment on a pull request after every TestDriver execution.

### Workflow Example
```yaml
name: TestDriver

permissions:
  actions: read
  contents: read
  statuses: write
  pull-requests: write

on:
  pull_request:

jobs:
  test:
    name: "TestDriver"
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    id: run-testdriver
    steps:
      - uses: dashcamio/testdriver@main
        version: v4.0.0
        key: ${{ secrets.TD_API_KEY }}
        with:
          prompt: |
            1. /run /Users/ec2-user/actions-runner/_work/testdriver/testdriver/.testdriver/test.yml
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          FORCE_COLOR: "3"

  - name: Create comment on PR
    if: ${{ always() }}
    uses: peter-evans/create-or-update-comment@v3
    with:
      issue-number: ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}
      body: |
        **Test Summary:**
        ${{ steps.run-testdriver.outputs.summary }}

        **Markdown Report:**
        ${{ steps.run-testdriver.outputs.markdown }}

        **Dashcam Link:**
        [View Test Results](${{ steps.run-testdriver.outputs.link }})
```

## Use Cases for Output Variables

### 1. Post Test Results as Comments
Use the `summary` and `markdown` outputs to post detailed test results as comments on pull requests. This provides immediate feedback to developers.

### 2. Send Notifications on Failure
Use the `success` output to trigger notifications (for example, email or Slack) when a test fails.

Example:
```yaml
- name: Notify on Failure
  if: ${{ steps.run-testdriver.outputs.success == 'false' }}
  run: |
    echo "Test failed! Sending notification..."
    # Add your notification logic here
```

### 3. Integrate with Third-Party Tools
Use the `link` output to upload test results to third-party test reporting tools or dashboards.

---

## Notes
- The `link` output provides a direct URL to the Dashcam dashboard, making it easy to debug test runs.
- The `markdown` output includes a screenshot of the desktop, which is useful for visualizing test results.
- Always use the `success` output to handle conditional workflows based on test outcomes.
