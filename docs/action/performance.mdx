## Overview
Optimizing your TestDriver tests can significantly reduce execution time, ensuring faster feedback for developers and smoother CI/CD workflows. While TestDriver's AI-powered capabilities are robust, using them efficiently is key to achieving the best performance.

## Tips for Improving Performance

### 1. Use Parallel Testing
Parallel testing allows you to split your test actions into multiple files and run them simultaneously. This can drastically reduce the total runtime of your test suite.

#### How to Implement Parallel Testing
- Divide your test steps into smaller, independent YAML files.
- Use the `run` command or GitHub matrix strategy to execute these files in parallel.

Example:
```yaml
strategy:
  matrix:
    test_file: 
      - tests/login.yml
      - tests/search.yml
      - tests/cart.yml
```

### 2. Use Optimized Matching Methods
For actions like `hover-text`, `wait-for-text`, and `scroll-until-text`, use the `turbo` matching method instead of `ai`. The `turbo` method uses text similarity to quickly compute the most relevant match, making it about 40% faster than the `ai` method.

#### Example:
```yaml
command: hover-text
text: Sign In
description: login button
action: click
method: turbo
```

---

### 3. Use `async` Asserts
The `assert` command supports the `async: true` property, allowing you to create non-blocking assertions. This means your tests can continue running while the assertion is being validated, saving valuable time.

#### Example:
```yaml
command: assert
expect: The user is logged in
async: true
```

---

## Best Practices
- **Minimize AI Matching**: Use AI-powered matching methods only when necessary. For common actions, rely on optimized methods like `turbo`.
- **Break Down Tests**: Split large, monolithic test files into smaller, focused tests to enable parallel execution.
- **Leverage Asynchronous Features**: Use `async` properties wherever possible to avoid blocking test execution.
- **Monitor Performance**: Regularly review test execution times and identify bottlenecks.

---

## Notes
- Optimizing performance not only saves time but also reduces resource usage, making your CI/CD pipelines more efficient.
- For large test suites, combining parallel testing with optimized matching methods can lead to significant time savings.
- Always balance performance optimizations with test reliability to ensure accurate results.
