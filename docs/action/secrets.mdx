## Overview
When using TestDriver to test your application, you may need to securely store and use sensitive information such as usernames, passwords, API keys, or other secrets. GitHub Actions provides a secure way to manage these secrets, ensuring they are not exposed in your test files or logs.

---

## Why Use Secrets?
- **Security**: Secrets are encrypted and stored securely in your GitHub repository.
- **Masking**: TestDriver automatically masks secrets in all test output, including debugging logs.
- **Reusability**: Secrets can be reused across multiple workflows and test files.

---

## Step 1: Replace Hardcoded Secrets in Test Files
To securely use secrets in your TestDriver test files, replace hardcoded values with placeholders in the format `${TD_YOUR_SECRET}`. TestDriver will parse and mask any secrets that begin with `TD_`.

### Example Test File
```yaml
version: 4.1.35
steps:
  - prompt: sign in with username and password
    commands:
      - command: focus-application
        name: Google Chrome
      - command: hover-text
        text: Email or phone
        description: email input field
        action: click
      - command: type
        text: ${TD_USERNAME}
      - command: hover-text
        text: Next
        description: next button after entering email
        action: click
      - command: hover-text
        text: Password
        description: password input field
        action: click
      - command: type
        text: ${TD_PASSWORD}
```

---

## Step 2: Add Secrets to Your GitHub Repository
1. Navigate to your GitHub repository.
2. Go to **Settings** > **Secrets and variables** > **Actions**.
3. Click **New repository secret**.
4. Add your secrets (e.g., `TD_USERNAME`, `TD_PASSWORD`, `TESTDRIVER_API_KEY`).

For detailed instructions, refer to the [GitHub Docs on using secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets).

---

## Step 3: Supply Secrets to GitHub Actions
When running TestDriver tests via GitHub Actions, supply your secrets in the `env` section of the workflow file.

### Example Workflow
```yaml
name: TestDriver Test

permissions:
  actions: read
  contents: read
  statuses: write
  pull-requests: write

jobs:
  test:
    name: "TestDriver"
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: testdriverai/action@main
        with:
          key: ${{ secrets.TESTDRIVER_API_KEY }}
          prompt: | 
            1. /run tests/signin.yml
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          TD_USERNAME: ${{ secrets.TD_USERNAME }}
          TD_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.TD_PASSWORD }}
```

---

## Best Practices
- **Use Descriptive Names**: Name your secrets clearly (e.g., `TD_USERNAME`, `TD_PASSWORD`) to make them easy to identify.
- **Rotate Secrets Regularly**: Update your secrets periodically to enhance security.
- **Limit Access**: Only provide access to secrets for workflows and team members that require them.
- **Mask Secrets**: Ensure all secrets are masked in logs by using the `TD_` prefix.

---

## Notes
- Secrets are encrypted and only accessible during the workflow run.
- TestDriver automatically masks secrets in test output to prevent accidental exposure.
- For additional security, avoid hardcoding sensitive information in your test files or workflows.
