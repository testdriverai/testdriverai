## Overview

TestDriver enables cloud-based testing using TestDriver's infrastructure directly through the CLI. This guide will walk you through the steps to configure TestDriver for GitHub actions, but the principles apply to other CI/CD platforms as well.

---

## Step 1: Get Your API key

To execute TestDriver actions on our virtual machines, you'll need an API key. Follow these steps to retrieve and configure your API key:

1. **Upgrade Your Account**: Ensure you have a paid TestDriver account.
2. **Log In**: Go to the **Team Page** in your TestDriver dashboard.
3. **Copy Your API Key**: Locate and copy your API key.
4. **Add the API Key as a GitHub Secret**:

- Navigate to your repository settings in GitHub.
- Add a new secret named `TD_API_KEY` and paste your API key.

---

## Step 2: Create your workflow

Now it's time to create your first TestDriver workflow. Add the following configuration to `.github/workflows/testdriver.yaml`:

```yaml
name: TestDriver

permissions:
  actions: read
  contents: read
  statuses: write
  pull-requests: write

on:
  pull_request: # Run on every pull request event
  schedule:
    - cron: "0 * * * *" # Run every hour
  push:
    branches:
      - main # Run on merge to the main branch
  workflow_dispatch: # Manual trigger

jobs:
  test:
    name: "TestDriver"
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Run TestDriver tests
        run: npx testdriverai@latset run testdriver/testdriver.yaml
        env:
          TD_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.TD_API_KEY }}
          FORCE_COLOR: "3"
```

### Key points:

- **Trigger Conditions**: The `on` section defines when the workflow runs (for example, pull requests, scheduled events, or manual triggers).
- **API Key**: The `TD_API_KEY` environment variable uses the secret for authentication.
- **Test Execution**: TestDriver is called directly with your test commands.

---

## Step 3: Deploy the workflow

Save the workflow file, create a new branch, and push it to your repository. Then, create a pull request to trigger the workflow.

```bash
git checkout -b testdriver
git commit -am 'Add TestDriver workflow'
git push origin testdriver
gh pr create --web
```

---

## How it works

1. **Trigger**: The GitHub workflow is triggered based on the conditions defined in the `on` section.
2. **Code Checkout**: The current branch's code is checked out in the GitHub runner.
3. **CLI Installation**: The TestDriver CLI is installed globally using npm.
4. **Authentication**: The `TD_API_KEY` environment variable authenticates your account.
5. **VM Setup**: An ephemeral virtual machine is spawned on TestDriver's infrastructure.
6. **Code Cloning**: The current branch's code is cloned onto the VM.
7. **Dashcam Recording**: Dashcam begins recording the test execution.
8. **Test Execution**: The TestDriver CLI executes your commands on the cloud VM.
9. **Test Summary**: TestDriver summarizes the test and sets the exit code based on the pass or fail state.
10. **Cleanup**: The VM is destroyed, and all data is wiped.

## Additional features

- **Multiple Commands**: You can run multiple TestDriver commands in sequence within your workflow.
- **Environment Variables**: Pass custom environment variables to your tests.
- **Staging Workflows**: A common workflow involves waiting for staging to deploy before executing tests.

## Output

For details on interpreting the output of TestDriver, refer to the [CLI Output Documentation](../cli/overview).

## Notes

- TestDriver CLI provides a simple and direct way to run cloud-based testing in your CI/CD pipelines.
- Ensure your API key is securely stored as a GitHub secret.
- The CLI automatically handles authentication and cloud VM provisioning when the `TD_API_KEY` is provided.
- For advanced workflows, consider using multiple TestDriver commands or custom environment variables.
