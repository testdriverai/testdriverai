## Overview
The TestDriver GitHub Action enables cloud-based testing using TestDriver's infrastructure. This guide will walk you through the steps to install and configure the GitHub Action for your repository.

---

## Step 1: Install the GitHub Action
TestDriver Cloud Testing is performed via the TestDriver GitHub Action. You can find and install the action from the GitHub Marketplace:

[**TestDriver.ai - GitHub Marketplace**](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/testdriver-ai)

---

## Step 2: Get Your API Key
To execute TestDriver actions on our virtual machines, you'll need an API key. Follow these steps to retrieve and configure your API key:

1. **Upgrade Your Account**: Ensure you have a paid TestDriver account.
2. **Log In**: Go to the **Team Page** in your TestDriver dashboard.
3. **Copy Your API Key**: Locate and copy your API key.
4. **Add the API Key as a GitHub Secret**:
   - Navigate to your repository settings in GitHub.
   - Add a new secret named `TESTDRIVER_API_KEY` and paste your API key.

---

## Step 3: Create Your Workflow
Now it's time to create your first TestDriver workflow. Add the following configuration to `.github/workflows/testdriver.yml`:

```yaml
name: TestDriver.ai

permissions:
  actions: read
  contents: read
  statuses: write
  pull-requests: write

on:
  pull_request: # Run on every pull request event
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 * * * *' # Run every hour
  push:
    branches:
      - main # Run on merge to the main branch
  workflow_dispatch: # Manual trigger

jobs:
  test:
    name: "TestDriver"
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: dashcamio/testdriver@main
        version: "v5.0.7"
        key: ${{ secrets.TESTDRIVER_API_KEY }}
        os: linux
        with:
          prompt: |
            1. /run testdriver.yaml
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          FORCE_COLOR: "3"
```

### Key Points:
- **Trigger Conditions**: The `on` section defines when the workflow runs (e.g., pull requests, scheduled events, or manual triggers).
- **API Key**: The `key` field uses the `TESTDRIVER_API_KEY` secret for authentication.
- **Prompt**: The `prompt` field specifies the commands to execute. In this example, the `/run` command is used to execute a test file from the repository.

---

## Step 4: Deploy the Workflow
Save the workflow file, create a new branch, and push it to your repository. Then, create a pull request to trigger the workflow.

```bash
git checkout -b testdriver
git commit -am 'Add TestDriver GitHub Action'
git push origin testdriver
gh pr create --web
```

---

## How It Works
1. **Trigger**: The GitHub Action is triggered based on the conditions defined in the `on` section.
2. **Authentication**: The `key` value authenticates your account.
3. **VM Setup**: An ephemeral virtual machine is spawned on TestDriver's infrastructure.
4. **Code Cloning**: The current branch's code is cloned onto the VM.
5. **Dashcam Recording**: Dashcam begins recording the test execution.
6. **Prerun Script**: If supplied, a prerun shell script is executed.
7. **Prompt Execution**: The `prompt` is parsed as a Markdown list, and each item is executed sequentially.
8. **Test Summary**: TestDriver summarizes the test and sets the exit code based on the pass or fail state.
9. **Cleanup**: The VM is destroyed, and all data is wiped.

---

## Additional Features
- **Dynamic Prompts**: You can use commands like `/explore`, supply variables, or dynamically generate prompts from earlier steps.
- **Staging Workflows**: A common workflow involves waiting for staging to deploy before executing tests.

## Notes
- The TestDriver GitHub Action is a powerful tool for automating cloud-based testing.
- Ensure your API key is securely stored as a GitHub secret.
- For advanced workflows, consider using prerun scripts or dynamic prompts to customize your tests.
