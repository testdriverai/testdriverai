## The problem with modern testing tools

Modern testing tools like Playwright are designed to test a single web application, running in a single browser tab using selectors.

However, selectors are often either unreliable or unavailable in complex scenarios, leading to brittle and flaky tests:

| Challenge | Problem | Examples |
|-----------|---------|----------|
| **Fast moving teams** | Frequently change UI structure, breaking CSS/XPath selectors | Agile teams, startups, vibe-coders |
| **Dynamic content** | Cannot be targeted with selectors | AI chatbots, PDFs, images, videos |
| **Software you don't own** | May lack proper accessibility attributes | Other websites, extensions, third-party applications |
| **Multi-application workflows** | Cannot be tested with web-only tools | Desktop apps, browser extensions, IDEs |
| **Visual states** | Impossible to verify with code-based selectors | Charts, graphs, videos, images, spelling errors, UI layout |

## The TestDriver Solution

TestDriver is a complete testing platform built specifically for handling these scenarios. It consists of a Javascript SDK, hosted infrastructure, and debugging tools that make it easy to write, run, and maintain tests for your most difficult user flows.

### Javascript SDK

Here is an example of a TestDriver test that installs a production Chrome extension from the Chrome Web Store and verifies that it appears in the extensions menu:

```javascript Installing Loom from the Chrome Web Store
import { describe, expect, it } from "vitest";
import { TestDriver } from "testdriverai/vitest/hooks";

describe("Chrome Extension Test", () => {
  const testdriver = TestDriver(context);

  // Launch Chrome with Loom loaded by its Chrome Web Store ID
  await testdriver.provision.chromeExtension({
    extensionId: 'liecbddmkiiihnedobmlmillhodjkdmb'
  });

  // Click on the extensions button (puzzle piece icon) in Chrome toolbar
  const extensionsButton = await testdriver.find("The puzzle-shaped icon in the Chrome toolbar.");
  await extensionsButton.click();

  // Look for Loom in the extensions menu
  const loomExtension = await testdriver.find("Loom extension in the extensions dropdown");
  expect(loomExtension.found()).toBeTruthy();
});
```


<Tip>[vitest](https://vitest.dev/) is the preferred test runner for TestDriver.</Tip>

### Selectorless Testing

By using AI-vision to understand your application, TestDriver can reliably interact with any element that appears on screen. TestDriver platform includes the AI SDK that makes this possible, a hosted caching infrastructure to speed up test runs and reduce costs, and debugging tools to help you quickly identify and fix issues.

### Full Desktop Environments

A secondary challenge of testing these flows is a lack of support for the test enviroments needed to run them. TestDriver provides pre-built infrastructure "recipes" for common use cases like desktop apps, browser extensions, and multi-application workflows.

### Observability

Given that TestDriver tests execute in the desktop environment, it's critical to have the right tools to debug issues when they arise. TestDriver includes powerful debugging and reporting tools to help you quickly identify and fix issues. This includes video replays, desktop logs, browser logs, browser network requests, and performance data from the machine.
