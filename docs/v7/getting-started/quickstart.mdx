TestDriver makes it easy to write automated computer-use tests for web browsers, desktop apps, and more. In this quickstart, you'll write and run your first TestDriver test using Vitest in just a few minutes.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a TestDriver Account">

    You will need a TestDriver account to get an API key.

    </Card>

  </Step>
  <Step title="Install TestDriver">

    Use `npx` to quickly set up an example project:

    ```bash
    npx testdriverai@beta init
    ```

    This will walk you through creating a new project folder, installing dependencies, and setting up your API key.

  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Run Your Test">

    TestDriver uses Vitest as the test runner. To run your test, use:
    
    ```bash
    npx vitest run
    ```

    This will spawn a sandbox, launch Chrome, navigate to the specified URL, and run your test commands.
