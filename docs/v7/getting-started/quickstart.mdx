## Get Started in 3 Steps

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a TestDriver Account">

    You will need a TestDriver account to get an API key.

    <Card
      title="Sign Up for TestDriver"
      icon="user-plus"
      href="https://app.testdriver.ai/team"
      arrow
      horizontal
    >
      No credit-card required!
    </Card>

  </Step>
  <Step title="Install TestDriver">

    Use `npx` to quickly set up an example project:

    ```bash
    npx testdriverai@beta init
    ```

    This will walk you through creating a new project folder, installing dependencies, and setting up your API key.

  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Run Your Test">

    TestDriver uses Vitest as the test runner. To run your test, use:
    
    ```bash
    vitest run
    ```

    This will spawn a sandbox, launch Chrome, and run the example test!
