Self-hosted pricing is based on **parallel test capacity**: the number of tests you can run simultaneously on **your infrastructure**. 

With self-hosting, you get:.

- **Flat license fee** per parallel test slot
- **Unlimited test execution** — run as many tests as you want
- **No device-second metering** — predictable monthly costs
- **Use your own AI keys** — control data usage with your own OpenAI, Anthropic, or other AI provider keys
- **Custom hardware & software** — choose instance types, resolution, install specific software, and configure networking as needed
- **Debug & Customize** — RDP into test machines, install custom software, modify the AMI, and debug issues directly. No black boxes.

## Who Should Self-Host?

Self-hosting is ideal for teams that:

- **Run high test volumes** — Flat pricing becomes more economical at scale
- **Want infrastructure control** — Custom hardware, specific software dependencies, or network configurations
- **Prefer predictable costs** — Budget with confidence using flat monthly fees


## How It Works

With self-hosting, you run test sandboxes on your own AWS infrastructure. TestDriver still provides:

- **Dashboard** — View test results, analytics, and reports at [console.testdriver.ai](https://console.testdriver.ai)
- **API** — Orchestration and AI-powered test execution
- **License Management** — Your parallel test capacity

You provide:

- **AWS Infrastructure** — EC2 instances running in your account
- **AI API Keys** — Use your own OpenAI, Anthropic, or other AI provider keys
- **Custom Configuration** — Hardware specs, networking, installed software
