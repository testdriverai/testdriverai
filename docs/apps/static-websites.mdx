# Testing Static Websites with TestDriver

TestDriver provides a powerful solution for testing static websites. With our platform, you can easily create and run tests to ensure your static website functions as expected across different browsers and devices.

## Getting started

To get started with testing static websites using TestDriver, follow these steps:

1. [**Follow our quick start guide to set up your TestDriver account.**](/getting-started/setup)
2. **Create a new test project** in your TestDriver dashboard.
3. **Add your static website URL** to the test settings.
   It looks like this in the `provision.yaml` file:

```yaml testdriver/lifecycle/provision.yaml
version: 6.0.0
steps:
  - prompt: launch chrome
    commands:
      - command: exec
        lang: pwsh
        code: |
          Start-Process "C:/Program Files/Google/Chrome/Application/chrome.exe" -ArgumentList "--start-maximized", "${TD_WEBSITE}"
          exit
      - command: wait-for-text
        text: ${TD_WEBSITE}
        timeout: 30000
```

Set the `TD_WEBSITE` environment variable to the URL of your static website. This will allow TestDriver to launch the browser and navigate to your website. You can do this by adding this `provision.yaml` file to your project or by simply using:

```bash
npx testdriverai@latest init
```

Running init will create the `provision.yaml` file for you and ask you which website to load with your test.
