# Testing Static Websites with TestDriver
TestDriver provides a powerful solution for testing static websites. With our platform, you can easily create and run tests to ensure your static website functions as expected across different browsers and devices.

## Getting Started
To get started with testing static websites using TestDriver, follow these steps:
1. **Follow our [quick start guide](/getting-started/setup) to set up your TestDriver account.**
2. **Create a new test project** in your TestDriver dashboard.
3. **Add your static website URL** to the test settings.
It looks like this in the `prerun.yaml` file:

```yaml
version: 5.1.1
session: 67f00511acbd9ccac373edf7
steps:
  - prompt: launch chrome
    commands:
      - command: exec
        lang: shell
        linux: |
          jumpapp google-chrome --disable-fre --no-default-browser-check --no-first-run "${TD_WEBSITE}" &
          exit
        mac: |
          open -na "Google Chrome" --args --disable-fre --no-default-browser-check --no-first-run --disable-features=PasswordManagerEnabled "${TD_WEBSITE}" &
          exit
        windows:
          Start-Process "C:/Program Files/Google/Chrome/Application/chrome.exe" -ArgumentList "--start-maximized", "${TD_WEBSITE}"
          exit
      - command: wait-for-text
        text: "Google Chrome"
        timeout: 30000
```
Set the `TD_WEBSITE` environment variable to the URL of your static website. This will allow TestDriver to launch the browser and navigate to your website. You can do this by adding this `prerun.yaml` file to your project or by simply using:
```bash
testdriverai init
```
Running init will create the `prerun.yaml` file for you and ask you which website to load with your test.
