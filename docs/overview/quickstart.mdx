TestDriver isn't just a computer-use agent, it's an entire AI-native workflow for creating end-to-end tests. Follow these steps to set up your environment and get started with TestDriver.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a TestDriver Account">
    Because TestDriver is powered by agentic users, a **free** account is required to access:

    - Dedicated Virtual Machines (VMs) for running agents
    - TestDriver AI \+ Vision models
    - Community support

  </Step>
  <Step title="Set up your environment">
      
    Copy your API key from [the TestDriver dashboard](https://app.testdriver.ai/team), and set it as an environment variable.
    
    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="macOS / Linux">
        ```bash Export an environment variable on macOS or Linux systems
        export TD_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
        ```
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="Windows">
      ```powershell Export an environment variable in PowerShell
      setx TD_API_KEY "your_api_key_here"
      ```
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>

  </Step>
  <Step title="Create your first test">
    Create a new file called `testdriver/test.yaml`, and paste the following [YAML](/commands) code into it.

    ```yaml testdriver/test.yaml
    steps:
      - prompt: Navigate to https://app.testdriver.ai
      - prompt: Verify the login form is displayed
    ```

    This is the basic structure of a TestDriver test. Each `step` contains a `prompt` that describes what the agent should do.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Run your first test">

    When running a test, TestDriver will use the prompts to generate [command](/commands)s that control a virtual machine. Use the following command to run your test:

    ```bash
    npx testdriverai@latest run testdriver/test.yaml --write --heal
    ```

    The `--write` flag will save generated commands to the test file, and the `--heal` flag will automatically fix any issues with the test.

    After running the command, you should see commands generated for each step in the `testdriver/test.yaml` file. It will look something like this:

    ```yaml testdriver/test.yaml {3-11, 13-15}
    steps:
    - prompt: Navigate to https://app.testdriver.ai
      commands:
        - command: focus-application
          name: Google Chrome
        - command: press-keys
          keys: [ctrl, l]
        - command: type
          text: https://app.testdriver.ai
        - command: press-keys
          keys: [enter]
    - prompt: Verify the login form is displayed
      commands:
        - command: assert
          expect: The login form is displayed
    ```

    This increases both speed and reliability, TestDriver will use the saved commands to execute the steps the next time you run the test.
