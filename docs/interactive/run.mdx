## Description
The `/run` command is used to execute a test file from a specified file. This command performs each step defined in the test file and outputs the results.

## Usage
```bash
/run <file>
```

## Example usage
```bash
testdriverai
> /run helloworld.yml
```
This command runs the `helloworld.yml` test file, executing each command in the file sequentially.

## Behavior
- TestDriver will execute the test file, performing each command as defined in the file.
- If the test completes successfully, the program will exit with code `0`.
- If any failures occur during the test, the program will output the errors and exit with code `1`.

## Protips
- Ensure the test file path is correct and accessible before running the command.
- Use descriptive filenames for your test files to make them easier to identify.
- Combine `/run` with debugging tools to troubleshoot failing tests.

## Gotchas
- This command will exit the program upon execution, so ensure all necessary setup is complete before running it.
- Any errors in the test file (for example, invalid commands or missing arguments) will cause the test to fail.

## Notes
- The `/run` command is ideal for executing pre-created test files in an interactive session.
- Use this command to validate and debug your test files during development.
