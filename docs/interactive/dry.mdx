## Description
The `/dry` command is used to create a test plan and write to a specified file. This command won't run steps it creates. It's a **dry** run. 

## Usage
```bash
/dry <file>
```

## Example usage
```bash
testdriverai <filename.yaml>
> /dry click the 'log in' button
```
This command generates the steps to `click the 'log in' button` with an explanation and adds them to the current test plan, without executing any command.

## Behavior
- TestDriver will create steps for the test plan, writing them in the file.
- TestDriver will also show the reasoning and test steps in the CLI:

```bash
thinking...

    To click the 'log in' button, we need to identify and
    click on the text "Log in" visible in the screenshot.
    Here's how to accomplish this:
    
    commands:
      - command: hover-text
        text: Log in
        description: log in button in the code editor
        action: click
    
    ### Explanation:
    
    1. Click the 'Log in' Button: We use hover-text to locate and click on the "Log in" text visible in the code editor. This ensures the button is activated.
```
## Protips
- Ensure you run the `testdriverai` command with a valid file path before using `/dry`.
- Use descriptive filenames for your test plans to make them easier to identify.
- Combine `/dry` with `/undo` to write test plans without executing them.


## Notes
- The `/dry` command is ideal for writing out a series of steps before executing.
