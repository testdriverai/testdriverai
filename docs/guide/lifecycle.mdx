# Lifecycle Files

TestDriver supports lifecycle files to customize test execution at different phases. These files allow you to define custom setup, provisioning, and cleanup steps that run automatically during test execution.

---

## Overview

Lifecycle files are YAML files placed in your repository's `lifecycle/` directory. TestDriver automatically executes these files during the appropriate phases:

- **`lifecycle/provision.yaml`**: Executed when a new sandbox is created
- **`lifecycle/prerun.yaml`**: Executed before tests run
- **`lifecycle/postrun.yaml`**: Executed after tests complete

---

## File Structure

All lifecycle files follow the standard TestDriver YAML format:

```yaml
version: 5.1.1
steps:
  - prompt: description of what this step does
    commands:
      - command: exec
        lang: pwsh
        code: |
          # Your PowerShell commands here
      - command: wait-for-text
        text: "Expected text"
        timeout: 30000
```

---

## Provision Scripts

The `lifecycle/provision.yaml` file is executed when a new sandbox is created. This is ideal for installing dependencies, setting up the environment, or preparing the system for testing.

### Example: `lifecycle/provision.yaml`

```yaml
version: 5.1.1
steps:
  - prompt: setup testing environment
    commands:
      - command: exec
        lang: pwsh
        code: |
          Start-Process "C:\Program Files\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe" -ArgumentList "--start-maximized --disable-infobars --disable-fre --no-default-browser-check --no-first-run --guest --load-extension=$(pwd)/node_modules/dashcam-chrome/build", "${TD_WEBSITE}"
      - command: wait-for-text
        text: ${TD_WEBSITE}
        timeout: 60000
```

### Common provision tasks:

- Installing software dependencies
- Setting up browser extensions
- Configuring system settings
- Downloading test data or assets

---

## Prerun Scripts

The `lifecycle/prerun.yaml` file is executed before each test run. This replaces the previous `prerun` parameter from the GitHub Action and is useful for preparing the immediate test environment.

### Example: `lifecycle/prerun.yaml`

```yaml
version: 5.1.1
steps:
  - prompt: launch chrome and start tracking
    commands:
      - command: exec
        lang: pwsh
        code: |
          Start-Process "C:\Program Files\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe" -ArgumentList "--start-maximized --disable-infobars --disable-fre --no-default-browser-check --no-first-run --guest --load-extension=$(pwd)/node_modules/dashcam-chrome/build", "${TD_WEBSITE}"
      - command: exec
        lang: pwsh
        code: dashcam track --name=TestDriver --type=application --pattern="C:\Users\testdriver\Documents\testdriver.log"
      - command: exec
        lang: pwsh
        code: dashcam start
```

### Common prerun tasks:

- Opening applications or browsers
- Navigating to starting pages
- Clearing application state
- Starting monitoring tools
- Setting environment variables

---

## Postrun Scripts

The `lifecycle/postrun.yaml` file is executed after tests complete. This is useful for cleanup tasks, generating reports, or capturing final state information.

### Example: `lifecycle/postrun.yaml`

```yaml
version: 5.1.1
steps:
  - prompt: cleanup and generate reports
    commands:
      - command: exec
        lang: pwsh
        code: dashcam -t '${TD_THIS_FILE}' -p
```

### Common postrun tasks:

- Generating test reports
- Capturing screenshots or logs
- Cleaning up temporary files
- Stopping background processes
- Uploading artifacts

---

## Environment Variables

Lifecycle files have access to TestDriver environment variables:

- `${TD_WEBSITE}`: The target website URL
- `${TD_THIS_FILE}`: Current test file name
- `${TD_API_KEY}`: Your TestDriver API key
- Custom variables defined in your workflow

### Using variables in lifecycle files:

```yaml
version: 5.1.1
steps:
  - prompt: setup with custom variables
    commands:
      - command: exec
        lang: pwsh
        code: |
          Write-Host "Testing website: ${TD_WEBSITE}"
          Write-Host "Current test: ${TD_THIS_FILE}"
          # Your setup commands here
```

---

## Best Practices

### Keep lifecycle files focused

Each lifecycle file should have a specific purpose:

- **Provision**: System-level setup
- **Prerun**: Test preparation
- **Postrun**: Cleanup and reporting

### Use appropriate commands

- Use `exec` with `lang: pwsh` for system commands
- Use TestDriver commands (`wait-for-text`, `hover-text`, etc.) for UI interactions
- Include appropriate timeouts for reliability

### Error handling

Include checks to verify operations completed successfully:

```yaml
- command: exec
  lang: pwsh
  code: |
    if (!(Test-Path "C:\Program Files\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe")) {
      throw "Chrome not found"
    }
    Start-Process "C:\Program Files\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe"
```

### Performance considerations

- Keep provision scripts efficient to minimize sandbox setup time
- Cache dependencies when possible
- Use lightweight operations in prerun/postrun scripts

---

## File Placement

Place lifecycle files in your repository's root directory:

```
your-project/
├── lifecycle/
│   ├── provision.yaml
│   ├── prerun.yaml
│   └── postrun.yaml
├── testdriver/
│   └── your-tests.yaml
└── package.json
```

---

## Execution Order

When TestDriver runs, lifecycle files execute in this order:

1. **Provision** (once per sandbox creation)
2. **Prerun** (before each test)
3. **Your test files**
4. **Postrun** (after each test)

---

## Troubleshooting

### Lifecycle files not executing

- Verify files are in the `lifecycle/` directory
- Check YAML syntax is valid
- Ensure version number is specified
- Verify file permissions in your repository

### Commands failing

- Check PowerShell syntax for `exec` commands
- Verify file paths exist on the target system
- Add error handling and logging
- Use appropriate timeouts for operations

---

Lifecycle files provide powerful customization capabilities for your TestDriver workflows. Use them to create reliable, reproducible test environments that meet your specific requirements.
