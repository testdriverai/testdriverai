The supported environment variables in TestDriver are:
<div className="env-vars-table">
|    Variable     |   Type    | Description |
|:---------------:|:---------:|-----------|
| TD_ANALYTICS  | boolean | Send analytics to TestDriver servers. This helps provide feedback to inform our roadmap. |
|  TD_API_ROOT  | string  | Developer only. Set API root to another URL. For on-prem. |
|  TD_API_KEY   | string  | Set this to spawn VMs with TestDriver Pro. |
| TD_RESOLUTION | string  | Change resolution when TD_VM is true. Format like `1280x1024`. |
|    TD_TYPE    | string  | Set the type of test to run. Can be `website`, `desktop`, or `mobile`. Not required. |
</div>

<GitignoreWarning />

## Example

```bash .env
TD_API_KEY=your_api_key
TD_RESOLUTION=1024x768
TD_TYPE=website
TD_WEBSITE=www.jeep.com
```

In this example `.env` file, we're running a website test in a local Linux VM with a resolution of 1024x768. The terminal will be minimized, and the overlay won't be shown. Analytics will be sent to TestDriver servers.
