This guide explains how to integrate **TestDriver** with **Netlify deployments** using the **GitHub Actions workflow**. By combining these tools, you can automatically test your Netlify preview deployments or production builds to ensure they meet your quality standards before merging or releasing.

---

## Workflow overview

1. **Trigger Netlify Deployment**: Use Netlify's GitHub integration to deploy your application on every pull request or push to the main branch.
2. **Run Tests on the Deployment URL**: Use the TestDriver GitHub Action to test the deployed application using the Netlify deployment URL.
3. **Report Results**: View test results in the GitHub Actions dashboard or as comments on the pull request.

---

## Prerequisites

1. **Netlify GitHub Integration**: Ensure your repository is connected to Netlify for automatic deployments.
2. **TestDriver API Key**: Store your API key as a GitHub secret (for example, `TD_API_KEY`).
3. **Netlify Deployment URL**: Use the `DEPLOY_URL` environment variable provided by Netlify to access the deployment.

## CI/CD workflow

Here's a complete workflow to test Netlify deployments with TestDriver CLI (adapt for your CI/CD platform):

```yaml
name: Test Netlify Deployment with TestDriver

on:
  pull_request:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  test-netlify:
    name: Test Netlify Deployment
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Check out repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Wait for Netlify Deployment
        id: netlify
        run: |
          echo "Waiting for Netlify deployment..."
          echo "Deployment URL: $DEPLOY_URL"
          if [ -z "$DEPLOY_URL" ]; then
            echo "Netlify deployment URL not found. Exiting."
            exit 1
          fi

      - name: Run Tests with TestDriver CLI
        env:
          TD_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.TD_API_KEY }}
          DEPLOY_URL: $DEPLOY_URL
          FORCE_COLOR: "3"
        run: |
          npx testdriverai@latest run --key "$TD_API_KEY" --headless --prompt "1. Open the deployment URL: $DEPLOY_URL\n2. Verify the homepage loads correctly\n3. Click the 'Sign Up' button\n4. Fill out the registration form\n5. Submit the form and verify the success message"
```

## Workflow steps explained

### 1. **Wait for Netlify deployment**

Netlify automatically sets the `DEPLOY_URL` environment variable for each deployment. This step ensures the deployment URL is available before running tests.

```yaml
- name: Wait for Netlify Deployment
  id: netlify
  run: |
    echo "Waiting for Netlify deployment..."
    echo "Deployment URL: $DEPLOY_URL"
    if [ -z "$DEPLOY_URL" ]; then
      echo "Netlify deployment URL not found. Exiting."
      exit 1
    fi
```

---

### 2. **Run tests with TestDriver CLI**

The TestDriver CLI runs tests on the deployed application using the deployment URL. The `--prompt` argument specifies the test steps to execute.

```yaml
- name: Run Tests with TestDriver CLI
  env:
    TD_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.TD_API_KEY }}
    DEPLOY_URL: $DEPLOY_URL
    FORCE_COLOR: "3"
  run: |
    npx testdriverai@latest run --key "$TD_API_KEY" --headless --prompt "1. Open the deployment URL: $DEPLOY_URL\n2. Verify the homepage loads correctly\n3. Click the 'Sign Up' button\n4. Fill out the registration form\n5. Submit the form and verify the success message"
```
