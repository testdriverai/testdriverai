# Testing Netlify Deployments with TestDriver GitHub Action

This guide explains how to integrate **TestDriver** with **Netlify deployments** using the **GitHub Actions workflow**. By combining these tools, you can automatically test your Netlify preview deployments or production builds to ensure they meet your quality standards before merging or releasing.

---

## Workflow Overview

1. **Trigger Netlify Deployment**: Use Netlify's GitHub integration to deploy your application on every pull request or push to the main branch.
2. **Run Tests on the Deployment URL**: Use the TestDriver GitHub Action to test the deployed application using the Netlify deployment URL.
3. **Report Results**: View test results in the GitHub Actions dashboard or as comments on the pull request.

---

## Prerequisites

1. **Netlify GitHub Integration**: Ensure your repository is connected to Netlify for automatic deployments.
2. **TestDriver API Key**: Store your API key as a GitHub secret (e.g., `TD_API_KEY`).
3. **Netlify Deployment URL**: Use the `DEPLOY_URL` environment variable provided by Netlify to access the deployment.

## GitHub Actions Workflow

Here's a complete workflow to test Netlify deployments with TestDriver:

### Workflow File: `.github/workflows/test-netlify.yml
```yaml
name: Test Netlify Deployment with TestDriver

on:
pull_request:
push:
branches: - main
workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
test-netlify:
name: Test Netlify Deployment
runs-on: ubuntu-latest
steps: - name: Check out repository
uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Wait for Netlify Deployment
        id: netlify
        run: |
          echo "Waiting for Netlify deployment..."
          echo "Deployment URL: $DEPLOY_URL"
          if [ -z "$DEPLOY_URL" ]; then
            echo "Netlify deployment URL not found. Exiting."
            exit 1
          fi

      - name: Run Tests with TestDriver
        uses: testdriverai/action@main
        with:
          key: ${{ secrets.TD_API_KEY }}
          prompt: |
            1. Open the deployment URL: $DEPLOY_URL
            2. Verify the homepage loads correctly
            3. Click the "Sign Up" button
            4. Fill out the registration form
            5. Submit the form and verify the success message
        env:
          DEPLOY_URL: $DEPLOY_URL
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          FORCE_COLOR: "3"

```

## Workflow Steps Explained

### 1. **Wait for Netlify Deployment**
Netlify automatically sets the `DEPLOY_URL` environment variable for each deployment. This step ensures the deployment URL is available before running tests.
```yaml
- name: Wait for Netlify Deployment
  id: netlify
  run: |
    echo "Waiting for Netlify deployment..."
    echo "Deployment URL: $DEPLOY_URL"
    if [ -z "$DEPLOY_URL" ]; then
      echo "Netlify deployment URL not found. Exiting."
      exit 1
    fi

```

---

### 2. **Run Tests with TestDriver**

The TestDriver GitHub Action runs tests on the deployed application using the deployment URL. The `prompt` field specifies the test steps to execute.
