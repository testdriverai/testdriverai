3. **Shared API Key**: Your shared API key that can be used for CI/CD workflows.
4. **Usage & Billing**: Monitor your usage and billing information. This includes your current plan, usage limits, and billing history.

5. **Replay Visibility**: Toggle whether your replays are public or private by default. This defaults to **private**.
