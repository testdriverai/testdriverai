From the Project view, you can see all the replays (Dashes) stored for that project. Click one to see it. These will also be linked in CI for any pull requests or branches that have been tested with TestDriver.

## New project

When you create a new Project, you can also enable the <Icon icon="jira" /> Jira integration to create issues automatically each time a replay (Dash) is created.

<Info>
  The project ID can be used in conjunction with your `lifecycle/postrun.yaml`
  script to automatically assign a replay to a project. For more info see the
  (Dashcam section)[/guide/dashcam].
