# TestDriver CLI Overview
The TestDriver CLI is a powerful tool designed to streamline the process of creating, managing, and executing automated tests. It provides a user-friendly interface for developers and testers to interact with the TestDriver framework.

```mdx
# Command: `testdriverai`

## Description
The `testdriverai` CLI is the primary interface for running, managing, and debugging TestDriver scripts. It provides commands to execute tests, validate configurations, and interact with the TestDriver framework.

## Usage
```bash
testdriverai <command> [options]
```

## Example Usage

### Running a Test Script
```bash
testdriverai run path/to/testdriver.yaml
```
This command runs the specified TestDriver script, executing all steps defined in the file.

### Validating a Script
```bash
testdriverai validate path/to/testdriver.yaml
```
This command checks the syntax and structure of the script to ensure it is valid before execution.

### Initializing a New Project
```bash
testdriverai init
```
This command sets up a new TestDriver project in the current directory, creating the necessary folder structure and configuration files.

### Checking the Version
```bash
testdriverai version
```
This command displays the installed version of the TestDriver CLI.

### Getting Help
```bash
testdriverai help
```
This command displays general help information. To get help for a specific command, use:
```bash
testdriverai help <command>
```

## Protips
- Use `testdriverai validate` before running a script to catch errors early.
- Combine `testdriverai run` with CI/CD pipelines to automate test execution.
- Use the `--debug` flag with `run` to enable detailed logging for troubleshooting.

<Info>
Running `testdriverai init` will create a blank `testdriver.yaml` file in the current directory. You can then edit this file to define your test steps.

## Notes
- The `testdriverai` CLI is cross-platform and works on macOS, Windows, and Linux.
- Ensure you have the required dependencies installed and configured before running scripts.
- For more advanced usage, refer to the official TestDriver documentation.
