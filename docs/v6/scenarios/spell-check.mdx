# Testing Spell Check with TestDriver

This scenario demonstrates how to automate testing the spell check functionality of a web application using TestDriver's capabilities. The test will check if the spell checker correctly identifies and suggests corrections for misspelled words in a text input field.

## Scenario overview

1. Open up a webpage that has text input and a spell check function.
2. Enter a misspelled word into the text input field.
3. Trigger the spell check function (for example, by clicking a button or losing focus on the input field).
4. Verify that the spell checker identifies the misspelled word and provides suggestions for correction.
5. Optionally, select a suggestion and apply it to the text input field.
