Parallel testing allows you to run multiple tests simultaneously, significantly reducing the time required to execute your test suite. By leveraging GitHub Actions' **matrix strategy**, you can dynamically distribute your tests across multiple jobs, ensuring efficient and scalable test execution.

---

## Why use parallel testing?

1. **Faster Execution**: Run multiple tests at the same time to reduce overall test duration.
2. **Scalability**: Easily scale your testing efforts as your test suite grows.
3. **Dynamic Distribution**: Automatically distribute tests across jobs using GitHub's matrix strategy.
4. **Cost Efficiency**: Optimize resource usage by running tests in parallel.

## Setting Up parallel testing with a matrix strategy

<Steps>
<Step titel="Organize Your Test Files">

Ensure your test files are stored in a directory (for example, `testdriver/`) and follow a consistent naming convention (for example, `test1.yaml`, `test2.yaml`, etc.).

</Step>

<Step title="Define the GitHub Action Workflow">

Here's an example of a GitHub Action workflow that uses the matrix strategy to run tests in parallel:

```yaml
name: Parallel Testing with TestDriver

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  pull_request:
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  gather-test-files:
    name: Gather Test Files
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    outputs:
      test_files: ${{ steps.test_list.outputs.files }}
    steps:
      - name: Check out repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Find all test files
        id: test_list
        run: |
          FILES=$(ls ./testdriver/*.yaml)
          FILES_JSON=$(echo "$FILES" | jq -R -s -c 'split("\n")[:-1]')
          echo "::set-output name=files::$FILES_JSON"

  run-tests:
    name: Run Tests in Parallel
    needs: gather-test-files
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        test_file: ${{ fromJson(needs.gather-test-files.outputs.test_files) }}
      fail-fast: false
    steps:
      - name: Check out repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Run TestDriver
        uses: testdriverai/action@main
        with:
          key: ${{ secrets.TD_API_KEY }}
          prompt: |
            1. /run ${{ matrix.test_file }}
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          FORCE_COLOR: "3"
```

</Step>
</Steps>

### Explanation of the workflow

1. **`gather-test-files` Job**:
  - Collects all test files in the `testdriver/` directory.
  - Outputs the list of test files as a JSON array.

2. **`run-tests` Job**:
  - Uses the matrix strategy to dynamically create a job for each test file.
  - Runs each test file in parallel using TestDriver.

3. **Matrix Strategy**:
  - The `matrix.test_file` variable represents each test file.
  - Each job runs a single test file from the `testdriver/` directory.

4. **Fail-Fast**:
  - Set to `false` to ensure all tests run even if one fails.

---

## Benefits of using the matrix strategy

1. **Dynamic Test Distribution**: Automatically adapts to the number of test files.
2. **Scalable**: Easily handles large test suites by distributing tests across multiple jobs.
3. **Efficient Resource Usage**: Runs tests in parallel, reducing idle time.

---

## Example output

When this workflow runs:
- Each test file (for example, `test1.yaml`, `test2.yaml`) is executed in its own job.
- The results of all tests are displayed in the GitHub Actions dashboard.

---

## Best practices

1. **Organize Test Files**: Use a consistent naming convention for test files to simplify management.
2. **Monitor Test Results**: Review the GitHub Actions dashboard to identify and debug failing tests.
3. **Optimize Test Files**: Ensure each test file is self-contained and doesn't depend on the execution of other tests.
4. **Use Fail-Fast Judiciously**: Enable `fail-fast: true` only if you want to stop all tests when one fails.

---

## Conclusion

Parallel testing with the GitHub Action matrix strategy is a powerful way to speed up your TestDriver test suite. By dynamically distributing tests across multiple jobs, you can ensure efficient execution and scalability, making it easier to maintain high-quality software.
