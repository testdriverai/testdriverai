Parallel testing allows you to run multiple tests simultaneously, significantly reducing the time required to execute your test suite. By leveraging GitHub Actions' **matrix strategy**, you can dynamically distribute your tests across multiple jobs, ensuring efficient and scalable test execution.

---

## Why use parallel testing?

1. **Faster Execution**: Run multiple tests at the same time to reduce overall test duration.
2. **Scalability**: Easily scale your testing efforts as your test suite grows.
3. **Dynamic Distribution**: Automatically distribute tests across jobs using GitHub's matrix strategy.
4. **Cost Efficiency**: Optimize resource usage by running tests in parallel.

## Setting Up parallel testing with a matrix strategy

<Steps>
<Step titel="Organize Your Test Files">

Ensure your test files are stored in a directory (for example, `testdriver/acceptance/`) and follow a consistent naming convention (for example, `login.yaml`, `signup.yaml`, etc.).

</Step>

<Step title="Define the GitHub Action Workflow">

Here's an example of a GitHub Action workflow that uses the matrix strategy to run tests in parallel:

```yaml
name: Parallel Testing with TestDriver

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  pull_request:
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  gather-test-files:
    name: Gather Test Files
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    outputs:
      test_files: ${{ steps.test_list.outputs.files }}
    steps:
      - name: Check out repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Find all test files
        id: test_list
        run: |
          FILES=$(ls ./testdriver/acceptance/*.yaml)
          FILENAMES=$(basename -a $FILES)
          FILES_JSON=$(echo "$FILENAMES" | jq -R -s -c 'split("\n")[:-1]')
          echo "files=$FILES_JSON" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT

  run-tests:
    name: Run Tests in Parallel
    needs: gather-test-files
    strategy:
      matrix:
        test: ${{ fromJson(needs.gather-test-files.outputs.test_files) }}
      fail-fast: false
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0

      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: "20"
          cache: "npm"

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: NODE_ENV=production npm ci

      - name: Run test in headless mode
        run: npx testdriverai@latest run testdriver/acceptance/${{ matrix.test }} --headless
        env:
          FORCE_COLOR: 3
          TD_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.TD_API_KEY }}
          TD_WEBSITE: https://testdriver-sandbox.vercel.app
          TD_THIS_FILE: ${{ matrix.test }}
```

</Step>
</Steps>

### Explanation of the workflow

1. **`gather-test-files` Job**:

- Collects all test files in the `testdriver/acceptance/` directory.
- Uses `basename` to get just the filenames without the full path.
- Outputs the list of test files as a JSON array for the matrix strategy.

2. **`run-tests` Job**:

- Uses the matrix strategy to dynamically create a job for each test file.
- Sets up Node.js and installs dependencies for TestDriver CLI.
- Runs each test file in parallel using `npx testdriverai@latest` with the `--headless` flag.

3. **Matrix Strategy**:

- The `matrix.test` variable represents each test filename.
- Each job runs a single test file from the `testdriver/acceptance/` directory.

4. **Environment Variables**:

- `TD_API_KEY`: Your TestDriver API key for authentication.
- `TD_WEBSITE`: The target website URL for testing.
- `TD_THIS_FILE`: The current test file being executed.

5. **Fail-Fast**:

- Set to `false` to ensure all tests run even if one fails.

---

## Benefits of using the matrix strategy

1. **Dynamic Test Distribution**: Automatically adapts to the number of test files.
2. **Scalable**: Easily handles large test suites by distributing tests across multiple jobs.
3. **Efficient Resource Usage**: Runs tests in parallel, reducing idle time.

---

## Example output

When this workflow runs:

- Each test file in `testdriver/acceptance/` (for example, `login.yaml`, `signup.yaml`) is executed in its own job.
- The results of all tests are displayed in the GitHub Actions dashboard with clear matrix job names.
- Failed tests can be easily identified and debugged individually.

---

## Best practices

1. **Organize Test Files**: Use a consistent naming convention for test files to simplify management.
2. **Monitor Test Results**: Review the GitHub Actions dashboard to identify and debug failing tests.
3. **Optimize Test Files**: Ensure each test file is self-contained and doesn't depend on the execution of other tests.
4. **Use Fail-Fast Judiciously**: Enable `fail-fast: true` only if you want to stop all tests when one fails.

---

## Conclusion

Parallel testing with the GitHub Action matrix strategy is a powerful way to speed up your TestDriver test suite. By dynamically distributing tests across multiple jobs, you can ensure efficient execution and scalability, making it easier to maintain high-quality software.
