TestDriver.ai provides robust cross-platform support, enabling you to run tests seamlessly on **Windows**, **Linux**, and **Mac** operating systems. This flexibility ensures that your applications are tested in environments that match your users' setups.

## Specifying the Operating System

When using the TestDriver GitHub Action, you can specify the target operating system by setting the `os` field. Supported values are:

- `windows`
- `linux`
- `mac`

Example:

```yaml
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: testdriverai/action@main
        with:
          os: linux
          key: ${{ secrets.TESTDRIVER_API_KEY }}
          prompt: |
            1. Open the browser
            2. Navigate to example.com

```

## Using the `prerun` Field

The `prerun` field allows you to execute a shell script before running your tests. This is particularly useful for:

1. **Downloading and Installing Applications**  
   Example: Downloading and installing a custom app or dependency.

2. **Installing Chrome Extensions**  
   Example: Adding a browser extension required for testing.

3. **Launching a Browser**  
   Example: Starting a browser with specific arguments or configurations.

### Example `prerun` Script

```yaml
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: macos-latest
    steps:
      - uses: testdriverai/action@main
        with:
          os: mac
          key: ${{ secrets.TESTDRIVER_API_KEY }}
          prompt: |
            1. Open the browser
            2. Navigate to example.com
          prerun: |
            # Download and install an app
            curl -o app.dmg https://example.com/app.dmg
            hdiutil attach app.dmg
            cp -R /Volumes/App/App.app /Applications/
            
            # Install a Chrome extension
            npm install dashcam-chrome
            open -a "Google Chrome" --args --load-extension=$(pwd)/node_modules/dashcam-chrome/build
            
            # Launch the browser
            open -a "Google Chrome"

```

## Write Once, Run Anywhere

TestDriver.ai uses **selectorless testing**, meaning tests are written in a generic format that works across all platforms. The AI dynamically adapts to the environment, ensuring that the same test can run on Windows, Linux, and Mac without modification.

### Benefits of Selectorless Testing

- **Reduced Maintenance**: No need to update selectors when UI changes.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Tests aren't tied to platform-specific configurations.
- **Ease of Use**: Write high-level, natural language prompts, and let TestDriver handle the rest.

### Example Test

```yaml
version: 4.2.18
steps:
  - prompt: Open the browser and search for "TestDriver.ai"
    commands:
      - command: focus-application
        name: Google Chrome
      - command: hover-text
        text: Search Google or type a URL
        description: main search bar
        action: click
      - command: type
        text: TestDriver.ai
      - command: press-keys
        keys: [enter]

```

This test will work on any supported operating system without modification.
