## Why Enterprise?

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Air-Gapped Security" icon="shield-check">
    Deploy everything in your environment. No data leaves your network. Complete isolation from external services.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Full Customization" icon="gear">
    Custom integrations, dedicated infrastructure, and tailored solutions for your unique requirements.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Self-Hosted Dashboard & API" icon="server">
    Run the entire TestDriver stack — dashboard, API, and test infrastructure — within your own environment.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Dedicated Support" icon="headset">
    Direct access to our engineering team for implementation, customization, and ongoing support.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Who Needs Enterprise?

Enterprise is designed for organizations that:

- **Require air-gapped deployments** — Regulated industries, government, defense, or strict compliance requirements
- **Cannot use external APIs** — Data must never leave your network perimeter
- **Need custom integrations** — Unique CI/CD systems, internal tools, or specialized workflows
- **Want dedicated support** — Direct engineering support for complex implementations

## What's Included

### Fully Self-Hosted Stack

Unlike [Self-Hosted](/v7/self-hosted) (which uses TestDriver's hosted dashboard and API), Enterprise deploys everything in your environment:

| Component | Self-Hosted | Enterprise |
|-----------|-------------|------------|
| Test Sandboxes | Your infrastructure | Your infrastructure |
| Dashboard | TestDriver hosted | Your infrastructure |
| API | TestDriver hosted | Your infrastructure |
| AI Processing | Your API keys | Your infrastructure |
| Data Storage | Your AWS account | Your infrastructure |

### Custom Contract Terms

- Volume-based pricing
- Custom SLAs
- Dedicated support channels
- Professional services for implementation
- Training for your team

## Implementation Process

<Steps>
  <Step title="Discovery Call">
    Discuss your requirements, security constraints, and integration needs with our team.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Architecture Review">
    Our engineers design a deployment architecture that meets your security and compliance requirements.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Deployment">
    We work with your team to deploy TestDriver within your environment, including dashboard, API, and test infrastructure.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Integration">
    Connect TestDriver to your CI/CD pipelines, internal tools, and workflows.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Training & Handoff">
    Comprehensive training for your team on operating and maintaining the deployment.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Security & Compliance

Enterprise deployments support:

- **SOC 2** compliance requirements
- **HIPAA** for healthcare applications
- **FedRAMP** for government deployments
- **PCI DSS** for payment processing
- **Custom compliance frameworks** as needed

<Note>
  All data remains within your network perimeter. TestDriver has no access to your test results, application data, or infrastructure.
</Note>

## Comparison: Self-Hosted vs Enterprise

| Feature | Self-Hosted | Enterprise |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| **Test Infrastructure** | Your AWS | Your infrastructure (any) |
| **Dashboard** | TestDriver cloud | Your infrastructure |
| **API** | TestDriver cloud | Your infrastructure |
| **Data Location** | Your AWS + TestDriver | 100% your infrastructure |
| **Network Requirements** | Internet access | Can be fully air-gapped |
| **Cloud Providers** | AWS only | Any (AWS, Azure, GCP, on-prem) |
| **Support** | Standard | Dedicated engineering |
| **Contract** | Standard licensing | Custom terms |
