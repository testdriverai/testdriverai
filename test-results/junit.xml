AI Response:
I need to analyze the screenshot to locate the shopping cart icon next to the Cart text in the top right corner.

Looking at the top right corner of the webpage, I can see there is a &quot;logout&quot; link and what appears to be a user account section. However, I don&apos;t see a visible shopping cart icon with &quot;Cart&quot; text in the typical top-right location.

Let me look more carefully at the interface. The main content shows product listings with &quot;Add to Cart&quot; buttons, but I need to find the shopping cart icon in the header area.

Actually, upon closer inspection of the browser interface and the webpage header, I cannot clearly identify a shopping cart icon with &quot;Cart&quot; text in the top right corner of this particular page. The top right shows &quot;logout&quot; text but no visible cart icon.

Since I cannot definitively locate a shopping cart icon next to Cart text in the top right corner based on what&apos;s visible in this screenshot, I should inform you that this element may not be present or visible in the current view.

However, if you&apos;re referring to a different element or if there&apos;s a cart icon that should be present, please let me know and I can help locate it more precisely." type="ElementNotFoundError">
